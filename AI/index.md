## Text Formatting

### Bold
To make text **bold**, wrap it with two asterisks or underscores.
- `**This is bold text**`
- `__This is also bold text__`

### Italic
To italicize text, wrap it with one asterisk or underscore.
- `*This text is italicized*`
- `_This text is also italicized_`

### Strikethrough
To ~~strikethrough~~ text, wrap it with two tildes.
- `~~This text is struck through~~`

### Underline (Workaround)
GitHub Markdown does not support underlining directly. A workaround is to use HTML:
- `<u>This text is underlined</u>`

### Combining Formatting
You can combine these formatting options:
- `**_This text is bold and italicized_**`
- `~~**This text is bold and struck through**~~`
